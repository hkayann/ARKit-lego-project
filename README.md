# PETRAS in Lego

PETRAS in Lego is a project where an augmented reality app developed using Xcode and ARKit. This app features a Lego city with augmented cards placed throughout, providing information about various Petras-IoT projects. When a user taps on an augmented card, it redirects them to a related web page for more information. Augmented cubes are provided to differentiate among both Petras Hub and Centre projects, and project fields.
